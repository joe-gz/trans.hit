This app will allow user to create an account and be validated each time they use the site via their email address
and password. Users will be able to view metro stations by clicking on them to see comments made by other users.
A user can also create a comment and have their comments assigned to a station. Developers can access our API and
pull all the number of comments at a specific station and the info on the amount of users in JSON format.
